# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data" - Week 3 Course Project from Coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

Following are the files in the repository:

1) `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
2) `run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just      importing the file.
3) `averages_data.txt` The ouput of the 5th step in the question and uploaded in the course project's form.

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
